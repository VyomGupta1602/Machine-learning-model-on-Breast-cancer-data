# Machine-learning-model-on-Breast-cancer-data
This project determines which model is the most efficient Model to predict results from a given set of data.
The project was made on Jupyter Notebook.
There are histograms and graph in the file, which will be easier to access on Jupyter NB.
Both the jupyter notebook file and python file will be uploaded, but incase of py file not working properly, try the the ipynb file.
In py file comments are made for each step explaing what the step is for.
The data for this was taken from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which will also be uploaded.
